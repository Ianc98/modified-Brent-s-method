# modified-Brent-s-method

This is a matlab code according to a modified Brent's method for finding zeros of functions by Gautam Wilkins and Ming Gu, which is published in Numerische Mathematik: 26 June 2012 (Mathematics Subject Classification (2000)   65Y20Â·65Y04).

When root_tol = 1e-12, func_tol = 1e-14, the number of function evaluations is almost the same as that in the thesis.
